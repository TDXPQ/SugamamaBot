Title: SugamamaBot  Author: TDXPQ (Aditya Jindal)

Sugamam(Bot) is a custom discord bot made for the HAIKYUU in COLOR!! discord server.
Primary functions are changing a voice channel so the name of the channel serves the purpose of the clock.
The time for the clock can be any valid time zone from the pytz library, and the clock can be directly
started or changed from discord using commands.
